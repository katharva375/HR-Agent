# Note: Only variables prefixed with VITE_ are exposed to your Vite client-side code.
# Do not put any private keys or secrets in this file if they are not VITE_ prefixed,
# as they might be bundled with your client application.
#
# For local development, create a .env file by copying this example:
# cp .env.example .env
# Then, fill in your actual credentials in the .env file.
# The .env file should be added to .gitignore to prevent committing your credentials.
